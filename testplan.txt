Howto:
The random data is generated by making an array of ints from 0 to length, then scrambling
In the function int Search(*int data, int target, int num),
	data is a pointer to the beginning of the array of data
	target is the value to search for inside the data
		our project will always search for 0 because it is already randomly positioned
	num is the number of threads/processes to be used to search the data simultaneously

	the threads/procs will be numbered from 0 to num-1, n
	each searchs data from (#data/num)*n to (#data/num)*(n+1)-1
		threads/procs return the index of the target or -1 if not found
	after all threads/procs return, function returns index of target or -1

Tests:
0	Searches array with 1 thread/proc
1	Make many arrays with 2^n length
	For each, search with 2^m thread/procs
		This tests both when the number of thread/procs == the length of the array
		and when there is 1 thread/proc
		and when there is a number of threads < the length and > 1
		n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
		m = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13] s.t. m<n
			this tests with 10 different lengthed arrays
		note: 2^13 is 8192
