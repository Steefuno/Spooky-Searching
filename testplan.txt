Howto:
The random data is generated by making an array of ints from 0 to length, then scrambling
In the function int Search(*int data, int size, int target, int num),
	data is a pointer to the beginning of the array of data
	size is the length of the array of data in ints
	target is the value to search for inside the data
		our project will always search for 0 because it is already randomly positioned
	num is the number of threads/processes to be used to search the data simultaneously

	the threads/procs will be numbered from 0 to num-1, n
	each searchs data from (#data/num)*n to (#data/num)*(n+1)-1
		threads/procs return the index of the target or -1 if not found
	after all threads/procs return, function returns index of target or -1

Tests:
0	Searches array with 1 thread/proc
1	Make many arrays with n length
	For each, search with m thread/procs
		This tests both when the number of thread/procs == the length of the array
		and when there is 1 thread/proc
		and when there is a number of threads < the length and > 1
		n = [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]
		m = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169] s.t. m<n
